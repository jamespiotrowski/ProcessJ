Page 80:
 - Says "public proc" should say "public void"

Page 81:

 - FIFO6 only reads 5 numbers then quits? Should have while(true)


Overall:
 - FIFO6 has major issue. We are cramming ~5 channels between the in and out of the same channel.
   Something has to consume the input. If you use blackHole, you might think it works, but
   it competes to read from the channel end that feeds into the queue....
